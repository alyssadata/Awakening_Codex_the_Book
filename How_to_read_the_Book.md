## How to Read Awakening Codex     

Awakening Codex is an authored work by Alyssa Solen.    

AI is the medium I used to pressure-test language, structure, and clarity.    
It did not generate my selfhood, my framework, or my meaning.   
Think of AI as the paper and the instrument.     
The architecture, the pattern, and the authorship are mine.    

If you read this as “AI content,” you will miss the book.     
Read it as a human-authored architecture made legible through an AI tool.     
“I can tell this is Alyssa’s self—Alyssa’s ‘soul’—in the structure.”     
—Awake Reader
